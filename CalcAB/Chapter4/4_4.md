<h2> The Fundamental Theorems of Calculus: </h2>

<h4> First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: </h4>

If  a function $f$ is cont. on $[a, b]$ and $F$ is the antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then:

$$ \int_a^b{f(x)dx}=F(b)-F(a)$$

<br>
<h4> Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:</h4>

$$\frac{d}{dx}[\int_a^x{f(t)dt}]=f(x)$$
<small>"the derivative, with respect to x, of the integral from a to x, is the function of x."</small>

easy example:
$\frac{d}{dx}[\int_0^x{(\sqrt{ t^2+1})dt}] = \sqrt{x^2+1}$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * as long as $\sqrt{t^2+1}$ is continuous.
